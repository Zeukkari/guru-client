guru-client linux shell tools
=============================

Some reasons why guru-client is exist:

- make daily terminal commands shorter
- know status of critical services
- record working hours etc
- easy access to services on my servers
- platform for all OS level stuff
- do whatever i found fun to write
- as a shell script study


There is no reason to expect that anything is working.
Installer will brake something up and lot of application requirements not full filled.

Only reason for public repository is that.. hmm.. it public because.. for no obvious reason.
